# Zwischen
The Car Sharing Application

## Project: Zwischen

Not every student at Fgcu has access to a car, and those who do may not have the desire to constantly use their own gas.
Compiled with FGCU’s focus on environmental care, students have every reason to carpool. Zwischen is a ride sharing app,
designed to help students at FGCU get around, as well as helping to reduce car emissions and forming friendships.

## Installation:

Clone from github

## Usage:
At first use, click the create account button, and fill in the text boxes with the appropriate information.
Once your account is created, log in, and either set your schedule by clicking the Driver Schedule button, 
or request a ride with the Request Ride button. Over time, friends can be added,
allowing for greater consistency of scheduling through the app.
